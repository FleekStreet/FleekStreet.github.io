<p>In a nutshell, we are mathematicians and web developers interested in creating the clearest and simplest breakdowns, explanations, and introductions to all things technology.</p>

<p>No doubt you have noticed that there is no lack of informational content out there.  Especially on the web.  Especially on technology. And a lot of this material is great.  But most of it requires quite a bit of mental fortitude and strain just to get the basics down.  And even if you manage to familiarize yourself with the lists of instructions and explanations, do you really truly understand the things you are doing? Do you understand clearly and on a fundamental level?  The answer to this becomes clear when one typo, bug, difference from the tutorial, departure from the beaten path, etc. reduces you to: </p>

<p>We aim to fill that gap by providing explanations that will allow you understand seemingly complicated topics and concepts with minimal mental gymnastics. From specific tools to the technologies they are built on, from mathematics to book reviews and project walkthroughs, we aim to provide the most easily digestible technology  material on the web.</p>
